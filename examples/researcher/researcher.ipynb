Neural search is especially suitable when a topic is well-known and popularly discussed on the Internet, allowing the machine learning model to retrieve contents which are more likely recommended by real humans.  \n",

If the query is a specific person's name, and identifier, or acronym, such that relevant results will contain the query itself, keyword search may do well. And if the machine learning model doesn't know about the topic, but relevant documents can be found by directly matching the search query, keyword search may be necessary.\n",

      "The Renaissance period, spanning from the 14th to the 17th centuries, was a transformative era in the realms of art, painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and literature across Europe. Characterized by a renewed emphasis on nature, a revival of classical learning, and a more individualistic approach towards man[#1], Renaissance art marked a departure from medieval artistic conventions. Artists during this time found inspiration in the classical art of ancient Greece and Rome, while also embracing scientific exploration to develop new techniques such as perspective image rendering for three-dimensional effects on flat surfaces[#2]. The shift towards humanism played a crucial role in liberating artists from the restrictions imposed by Christian theology, allowing them to explore themes like the beauty of the human body and architectural constructs[#2]. Figures like Piero Della Francesca and Raphael exemplified the spirit of the Renaissance through their groundbreaking works, contributing significantly to the evolution of art during this period[#3][#4].\n",
      "\n",
      "Lorenzo Lotto's portrait of Saint Catherine stands as a vivid example of the brilliance and vibrancy achieved by Renaissance painters. The skilled use of colors like intense greens and deep reds, along with intricate detailing of fabric textures, brought a sense of life and vibrancy to the painting, capturing the viewer's attention and admiration[#5]. The art of color during the Renaissance was not limited to painting but extended to various trades like glassmaking, textile dyeing, and pigment preparation. Venetian colore, in particular, was renowned for its sheer brilliance and innovative use of colors brought forth by specialized artists and color merchants who offered a diverse range of materials for artisans and craftsmen involved in the vibrant color industry[#6].\n",
